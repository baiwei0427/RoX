	updatetime timestamp,
	datapath varchar(15),
	ackpath varchar(15),
	rate int unsigned,
	dscp int unsigned,
	is_finish boolean
);

jobid: id of job, a global variable
sender: IP address of sender (iperf client) 
receiver: IP address of receiver (iperf server)
port: TCP port that iperf servers listen on (e.g. 5001)
datapath: path ID for data traffic (from sender to receiver)
ackpath: path iD for ACK traffic (from receiver to sender)
starttime: when to start this job
protocol: TCP(6) or UDP (17)
classid: tc class id for traffic shaping (rate limiting) in sender side (used by tc htb class). Two jobs cannot share the equal classid in a NIC of a server.
netdev: network device name of sender to send this job (e.g. eth0, eth1...)
volume: Size of traffic to send
rate: sending rate
dscp: value of Differentiated Services Code Point
is_start: whether this job has beem started
last_update: last update time (e.g. start job, update job setting)

You can only change datapath, ackpath, rate ,dscp of a job via event.
