nf-HiShape Documentation
========================

nf-HiShape is a kernel module for traffic shaping according to the source ip
address. It registers a definable netfilter hook (e.g. for forwarded packets).
For every packet that should be forwarded this hook is called. nf-HiShape
decides if the packet should be dropped, queued or accepted based on the network
input device and the entitled bandwith previously assigned to this ip address of
the packet. The device can be specified by the module parameter 'device' or
later using the userland tool. If no device is given, packets of all devices
will be filtered. 

Prerequisites
-------------

- prepared linux kernel headers
     

Compilation & Installation
--------------------------

inside the source folder, type
:~# make
:~# sudo make install
:~# sudo mknod /dev/nf-hishape c 100 0

Module load
-----------

:~# modprobe nf-hishape <key=value ...>


Module unload
-------------

:~# rmmod nf-hishape


Module parameters
-----------------

device          the network device at which the filtering should be processed
                (e.g. eth0)
				if none is given, the filtering is done on all devices
                
hook			position in the netfilter stack where the shaping should be
				processed
				possible values are:
				pre			for pre-routing
				in			for input
				for			for forward
				out			for output
				post		for post-routing
				
priority		priority of the whole packet filter module
				small number indicates high priority


Userland tool
-------------

Usage: ./nf-hishape [OPTION...]

 Options:

  -L, --list               List the ranges
  -F, --flush              Flush the ranges
  -S, --set=FILE           Load ranges from FILE
  -i, --interface=DEVICE   Set interface to DEVICE
  -a, --any_device         Unset interface
  -p, --print_interface    Print interface
  -f, --from               Start ip address for a new range (integer or dotted notation)
  -t, --to                 End ip address for a new range (integer or dotted notation)
  -l, --limit              Limit of the new range in kbyte/s
  -h, --help               Print this message and exit
